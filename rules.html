        <h1>Rules of the Game</h1>
        <h2>Round 1</h2>
        <p>The rules of this round are like Taboo where you can do anything to
          get your team to guess the word other than saying the word.  Teams go
          back and forth getting as many words as they can in a minute until all words
have      been guessed.  This signals the end of each round. </p>
        <h2>Round 2</h2>
        <p>Now you can only use charades to get your team to guess the words.  Although the words
have not changed so if you were paying attention in round one this should help. </p>
        <h2>Round 3</h2>
        <p>The most challenging round, where you are only allowed to give
a single word as the clue.  Hopefully your teammates have a good memory
 from the previous two rounds!</p>
